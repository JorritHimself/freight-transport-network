freight_transport_network
=========================

Python implementation of a bimodal (railway and roadway) freight transport
network cost model.

This a cost model for the freight transport network of Argentina. It is still
under heavy development so big changes should be expected. Also, there is no
yet a full scheme of unit tests. Some classes are manually tested.
